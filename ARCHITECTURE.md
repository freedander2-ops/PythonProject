# Capability-Oriented Design

The system is capability-driven.

Each capability:

* owns its logic;
* exposes explicit interfaces;
* avoids hidden dependencies;
* remains independently replaceable.

Benefits:

* easier AI-assisted refactoring;
* safer scaling;
* modular testing;
* lower maintenance complexity.

---

# AI Integration Architecture

The system should support:

* provider abstraction;
* model replacement;
* local inference;
* multi-model orchestration.

Potential providers:

* OpenAI
* Claude
* Gemini
* Qwen
* DeepSeek
* Ollama/local models

Architecture rule:
LLMs are interchangeable providers, not hardcoded dependencies.

---

# Memory Layer

Purpose:

* preserve engineering decisions;
* store prompts;
* maintain research context;
* support future RAG systems.

Memory categories:

/memory/research
/memory/decisions
/memory/prompts
/memory/incidents
/memory/context

---

# Security Architecture

## Threat Surface

Main risks:

* API token leaks;
* malicious prompts;
* dependency compromise;
* unsafe integrations;
* abuse automation;
* excessive permissions.

---

## Security Controls

Required:

* .env isolation;
* dependency pinning;
* secret scanning;
* structured logging;
* permission boundaries;
* rate limiting;
* audit logging.

---

# Observability

The system must support:

* structured logs;
* execution tracing;
* incident debugging;
* async task visibility.

Recommended:

* correlation IDs;
* categorized logs;
* error aggregation.

---

# Deployment Strategy

Preferred deployment:

```text
GitHub
   │
   ▼
CI/CD
   │
   ▼
Docker Runtime
   │
   ▼
Bot Runtime Environment
```

Potential environments:

* VPS
* Docker host
* Kubernetes
* local development
* hybrid AI infrastructure

---

# Scalability Philosophy

Scale gradually.

Avoid:

* premature microservices;
* distributed complexity;
* overengineered abstractions.

Prefer:

* modular monolith;
* explicit contracts;
* isolated capabilities.

---

# Operational Philosophy

The repository should remain:

* understandable;
* portable;
* resilient;
* AI-assisted;
* solo-maintainable.

Complexity must grow slower than functionality.
